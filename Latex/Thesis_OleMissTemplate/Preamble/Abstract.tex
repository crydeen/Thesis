As the machine learning and data science craze sweeps the nation, the implications and implementations are vast.
This paper takes a look at both of them through the lens of a topic of national importance, at the very least for the United States.
This topic is the words used by past Presidents of the United States, which are being pulled from their State of the Union Addresses.
These two broad subjects are implemented in varying degree by means of Natural Language Processing (NLP), of which this paper is centered around.
Natural Language Processing pulls heavily from both of these two categories to enable effective analysis of text-based data.
Using NLP, a sentiment analysis was conducted on the Addresses to gain further insight into the tone used by Presidents over the course of history.
This paper shares the methodology used to conduct this sentiment analysis and discusses how it was presented and \href{https://turing.cs.olemiss.edu/~dcrydeen/thesis/index.html}{visualized}.
