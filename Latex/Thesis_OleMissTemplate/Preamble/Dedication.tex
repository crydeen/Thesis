I dedicate this thesis to all of the furry friends in my life that have kept me company throughout this process, most importantly Scrappy and Sherlock. 
And also to the many musical overtures that I listened to while working on my thesis by the great musicians Travis Scott, Chance the Rapper, Vance Joy, and Brockhampton. 
This has been an enlightening experience and I have gained a newfound respect for research and the difficult process it entails. 
I would also like to thank Kathryn for keeping me going and keeping me productive and my mom for always being a phone call away when I needed to complain about having so much work to do.
