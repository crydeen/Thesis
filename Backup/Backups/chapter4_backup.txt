\section{Topic Classifier Sets}
An important part of the latter half of the preprocessing work for this research was the topic classifier sets.
At first, the sentiment score was calculated for each presidential address with an overall score from -1 to 1, indicating their tone when delivering that address.
After these were calculated, they were analyzed to look for trends in each president's tone to see if there were any interesting observations to be seen.
As an additional breakdown to see if there was any more context-specific information that could help determine a president's political party, topic categories were added to diversify the scores of the president's even more.

Four Presidential Addresses were chosen (Washington, Lincoln, Kennedy, Obama) and manually read through to discover what words were being used when talking about certain topics within the United States. The topics that were chosen were: crime, economy, education, energy, environment, family, foreign, government, job, religion, terrorism, and war. Text files were created using the trigger words for each major topic, the trigger words being pulled from the four addresses mentioned above and throughout various other addresses as they were skimmed through, that would add the entire sentence to an array named for what topic it was going to collect information on. This processing was conducted on every address and the sentiment score for each topic was found for each president, which resulted in a vector for each address that had their overall sentiment score and the sentiment score for each topic covered in the address. These scores for each address were then averaged together to create an overall vector for each president that could be used for classification and learning to learn their political party and predict others.
